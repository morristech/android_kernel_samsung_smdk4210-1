Hi Stalker.. lol kidding




Hi there,



Welcome to my github repo for Galaxy Note CM10.1 kernel.
To build this kernel, you will need to put in some efforts.
If you are a kernel developer or a recognised developer or a kernel virtuso and wish to contribute here, send me a PM on XDA.

Before you read ahead, make sure you are able to build CM10.1 ROM for N7000.

Now sync this repo on your system.

Goto Kernel/Samsung and delete contents of smdk4210.
(You can get back original deleted stuff by repo sync in ~/android/system)

Paste in the contents from my repo.

Goto ~/android/system via terminal

Type 

. build.sh n7000 kernel

It is advisable to run as root.
